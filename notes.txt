Portfolio process thoughts:

-- initially began planning the mobile layout with a sidemenu, but upon researching more about best practices, found that it
cuts user engagement down in a very "out of sight, out of mind" way.

However, I still like how it leaves real estate for the rest of the screen, so I'll work on other layouts that keep the
sidemenu but with a visual clue?

-- horizontal nav


-------------------------

Plans:

-- going to make input boxes oval and white, with no borde but material-design-esque diffuse shadows
