Portfolio process thoughts:

-- initially began planning the mobile layout with a sidemenu, but upon researching more about best practices, found that it
cuts user engagement down in a very "out of sight, out of mind" way.

However, I still like how it leaves real estate for the rest of the screen, so I'll work on other layouts that keep the
sidemenu but with a visual clue?

-- horizontal nav

-- originally reused a template system from a more dynamic project
-- that took nav clicks, found the page template, created it, set variables, etc
-- but that wasn't right for this project; content is largely static even if animated visually
-- and it relied on javascript to load content, via the AJAX call, which I didn't want
-- so it's a one-page system now instead.

-- likewise, some nav items were actually links instead of site pages (portfolio, resume, blog)
-- so now portfolio and resume have download buttons separate from the nav, instead.

Plans:

-- going to make input boxes oval and white, with no borde but material-design-esque diffuse shadows

-- need to add "download" glyph to port/res buttons
